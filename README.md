# Cyclistic-bike-share-Case-Study
Crafting strategic marketing initiatives aimed at converting occasional cyclists into dedicated members for Cyclistic, leveraging advanced data analytics techniques.

I have recently completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera. My final capstone project involves analyzing a public dataset for a fictional company, utilizing the R programming language for data analysis and Tableau for visualizations. Excited to share the insights gained from this endeavor!

## About the Company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

### Data Analysis Steps

The following data analysis steps will be followed:
1. **Ask**: The questions that need to be answered are:
    - How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
    - Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
    - How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

2. **Prepare**: The dataset follows the ROCCC Analysis as described below:
    - Reliable - yes, not biased
    - Original - yes, can locate the original public data
    - Comprehensive - yes, not missing important information
    - Current - yes, updated monthly
    - Cited - yes

    I will be using the public dataset located [here](link_to_dataset). The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under [this license](link_to_license).

    Key Tasks Followed:
    - Downloaded data and copies have been stored on the computer.
    - Downloaded the data for April 21-March 22 Period.
    - The data is in CSV (comma-separated values) format, and there are a total of 13 columns.

3. **Installing and loading required packages**

```R
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("lubridate")
install.packages("janitor")
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
